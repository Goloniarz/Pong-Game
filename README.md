# Pong-Game

The Pong game is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle. The objective of the game is to hit the ball with your paddle and make it pass the opponent's paddle. The game follows these rules:

The left player controls the left paddle using the 'W' and 'S' keys to move up and down, respectively.
The right player controls the right paddle using the up and down arrow keys.
The ball starts in the center of the screen and moves at a constant velocity.
Players hit the ball by colliding their paddles with it.
If a player successfully hits the ball past the opponent's paddle, they score a point.
The game continues until one player reaches a specific score limit (usually 10 points) or until the players choose to quit the game.
The score of each player is displayed at the top center of the screen.
After a point is scored, the ball is reset to the center of the screen, and the game resumes.
